      TakeTest is an online test app. Nowadays all organisations are shifting to online tests and it is difficult to code each time the organisations conducts a test.<br><br>
The organisation that is hosting the test will have to upload a .txt file of a set format. The application will then retrieve questions, options and answers and create user interface for the test. Students can then visit the taketest website and take the test .<br><br>
After the completion both the organisation and student can analyse their result. The analysis report for these both parties is different.
